Everything in React is a Component.

There are two types of Components in React
1.Class Based Components.-OLD WAY
2.Functional Components.-(Just a normal JavaScript Function which returns a JSX code)

Q:What is component composition?
Ans: Wrapping one component into another
eg:

const JsxHeading = ()=> (
    <h2 className="head" tabIndex="5">
        Hello All!
    </h2>
    );

const Heading = () => (
    <div id="container">

        <JsxHeading />

        <h1 className="heading">Hello From React JSX</h1>
    </div>
)
