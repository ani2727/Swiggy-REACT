1.NPM-> It is not NODE PACKAGE MANAGER. It doesn't have any specific full form.

2.There are two types of dependencies in NPM:
 i.devDependencies(Used during development period)
 ii.dependencies(Used after hosting or deploying the project)

3.Package.json file is the file which is used to configure the NPM and keeps track of approx all the versions.

4.package-lock.json: keeps the tracks of exact version installed.

5.Node Modules: Fetches all the code required for the dependencies.

6.Transitive dependencies: If we install "parcel" it has its own dependencies to install and like this those files will also have the dependencies of their own 
                            This is called Transitive dependency.

7. JSX- JavaScript Syntax: is not a part of React it is separate from react.
Even without JSX also we can write the code.

8. JSX is not HTML inside JS. It is HTML like syntax.
  - To write attribute in JSX(html like code) follow camelCase. eg.className,tabIndex,etc, ..

9. Babel is a JavaScript Compiler also converts JSX code to React code


10. There are two types of Imports/Exports
  i.default import/export :
      ---> Used only when single component is to be exported
      syntax: Export: export default (nameoftheexport eg:logo);
              Import: import logo from "path"
  ii.named import/export 
    ---> Used when more things component to be exported.
    syntax: Export: export const (name eg: logo) = {contentofthelogo};
            Import: import {logo} from "path"

11.Hooks: Hooks are nothing but the simple javascript functions with super powers in it.

12. Reconsciliation algorithm:React Fiber(From React-16):
    --->React is fast because it is doing efficient DOM manipulation using virtual DOM.

Hooks:
  React:
    1.useState();//Mostly Used
    2.useEffect();
  React-Router-DOM:
    1.useRouteError();

12. ComponentDidMount --> used for making API calls as it is not executed till the Render funtion is completly executed.
                          so we will not be waiting for the API to load instead we render first and then try to fetch the API data.
                          That's why we use UseEffect() method and make API class as it also executes after the total rendering of component.
                  
13. React has 2 phases:
  1.Render Phase
  2.Commit Phase

14.lazy and suspense: Important to divide the data into chunks.
    lazy: it will make sure that the specific component is not loaded until demand.
    suspense: It will have fall back function which is used to show or render something on the screen until the component is loaded.
